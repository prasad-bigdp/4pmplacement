JS Validators : 
HTML Provides basic validation to input elements such as required, disabled, readonly, min,max,minlength,maxlength and pattern
JS also provides validations using conditional statements and regular expressions
Regular Expressions: Regular Expressions are used to match a pattern in given string
It uses  different symbols for validations
[]   --- represents GROUP
{a,b}  --- represents range like length from a to b
{a}   --- fixed number of characters 'a'
{a,}   -- atleast 'a' number of characters
+      -- atleast one occurence
*      -- atleast zero occurence
?      -- either zero or one occurence of GROUP
.      -- it is wilicard character , it can become any character

Groups : 
[A-Z]    -- uppercase alphabets
[aeiou]  -- any one vowel
[A-Za-z]  -- any alphabet
[0-9]    -- any numerical value
\w       -- words
\d       -- digits
\s       -- space

Mostly regular expressions starts with ^ and ends with $
/^[A-Za-z0-9]{3,}$/
