Document Object Model:
    Document is an object that contains complete HTML,CSS elements in Tree structure. That tree is called DOM tree. Each element in this tree is called "node"
    console.log(document)
    Accessing HTML elements:
    There are 5 ways to access an Element in HTML
    i. getElementsByTagName('tagName'): it is used to access HTML elements using document object by tagname but it selects all elements of specific tag name  and returns an array
    ii. getElementsByClassName('className'): it is used to select/access HTML elements using document object by class name but it selects all elements of specific class name and returns an array
    iii.getElementById('idname'): it is used to select/access HTML element using document object by Id.
    iv. querySelector('query'): it selects element based on css query but it selects only first element that accepts query
    v. querySelectorAll('query'): it selects elements based on CSS query but it selects all elements that accepts query

DOM Manipulation:  we can manipulate or change HTML elements and their styles using document object and following properties
    i. textContent :  it is used to access/update content inside an element
    ii. innerText : it is also used to access/update content inside an element but it also observes CSS. incase of visibility :none, it cannot access element
    iii. innerHTML : it is used to access/update HTML code inside an element
     iv. style : it is used to acess/update styles of an element
     v. classList : it is used to add classname or remove class name or toggle classname of an element
