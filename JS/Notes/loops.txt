Loops: loops are used to repeat or iterate a certain block of statements. There are two kinds of loops such as
   i. Entry control loops
   ii. Exit control loops

Entry Control Loops:  These loops checks the condition before executing the statements. block will be exected only if condition is true. After executing, again condition will be checked and repeat the process until condition is false
   Eg: while, for

Exit control loops: These loops checks the condition after the block is executed and if it is true , again execute the block, if it is false, it will end. Even though inital value not satisfy the condition, one time the block execute
   Eg: do while

while:  while is used as a entry control loop which contains initialization, condition and updation in three different lines
  initialization;
  while(condition){
    statements;
    updation;
  }

do while: do while is used as exit control loop which contains initialization,condition and updation in three different lines
 initialization;
 do{
    statements;
    updation;
 }while(condition);

for() : for is used as entry control loop which contains initialization, condition and updation in single line
for(initialization;condition;updation){
    statements;
}

  for..of(): This variant of for, used to iterate through the array and print array elements
     for(let variable of arrayname){
        statements; // here variable will be array value
     }

  for..in(): This variant of for, used to iterate through the addresses of array or object values.
     for(let variable in arrayname){
        statements; //here variable will be index value
     }



practise:
 //Input: "PRASAD" -----> output: "DASARP"
 let str="prasad",str1='';
  for(let i=str.length-1;i>=0;i--)
  {
    str1= str1+ str.charAt(i)
  }
  console.log(str1)

  // Input : "CAT", "ACTT"

  // 4 3 2 1
  // 4 3 2
  // 4 3
  // 4
  // s1:   
  let str=''
   for(let r=4;r>=1;r--){
      str=''
      for(let j=4;j>=(5-r);j--){
        str=str+j+" "
      }
      console.log(str)
   }
